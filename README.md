# 3rd year Databases project
This repository contains a project developed for my Databases course.
The application simulates a functional store management system, featuring a graphical user interface and database integration.

The app supports admin operations such as:
* Adding new products/listings
* Editing existing entries
* Removing listings from the store

The project demonstrates practical usage of database design, CRUD operations, and GUI–database interaction.
